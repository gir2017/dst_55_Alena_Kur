1. The main goal: to analize the provided data using pandas
2. Number of points = 27
3.	1 - I've find the solution of the 27th task without slack, so I'm happy about it.
	2 - I haven't found the way, how to explode splitted data of multiple columns with different number of arguments (14th task)
	3 - In current module we've started to work with pandas, studied how to analize the data.
	4 - Finishing the project in time using pandas is the main result in this module.
	5 - I'm planning to learn pandas & python deeper, so to spend more time here. Also start to prepare projects in advance.
