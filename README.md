# Data science beginner projects

## Description
Study projects developed during data science courses.

### module_0<br>
The function guesses the number and prints the number of attempts.

### module_1<br>
Studying the provided data using pandas.

### module_2<br>
EDA, prepare the data for the machine learning
+ Filter outliers
+ Perform correlation analysis in quantitative data
+ Perform analysis of the nominative variables
+ Select columns for the machine learning step.

### module_3<br>
 Predict tripadvisor restaurant rating.
+ Data cleaning
+ Filling NA
+ Outlier removing
+ Feature Engineering
+ EDA
+ Using ML first time with default parameters<br>
First whole data preprocessing with eda and feature engineering.

### module_4
Bank score prediction project
+ Data cleaning
+ Filling NA
+ Outlier removing
+ Feature Engineering
+ EDA
+ Naive model
+ PCA, SVD to reduce the matrix size
+ Hyperparameter tuning

### module_8
Predict car classes from the pictures using deep learning
+ 6 types of augmentation
+ Different sizes of images starting from 512 to 224
+ Different number of epochs
+ Different batch sizes
+ All model types that are presented in tf.keras.applications
+ Fine-tuning and transfer learning
+ LR were optimized using ReduceLROnPlateau
+ Different optimizers
+ Batch Normalization
+ Different callback Keras functions
+ TTA
+ Different head architecture

### new_module_2
Analysis of vacancies from HeadHunter using SQL query in jupyter notebook

### diplom
Property price prediction<br>
The data have a lot of outliers, mistakes, input errors, slang abbreviations, that's why the project was split into 2 parts data_cleaning.ipynb and eda_ml.ipynb<br>
+ Data cleaning
+ Data Enrichment
+ EDA
+ Feature Engineering
+ ML
+ Outlier removal using different models: IsolationForest, EllipticEnvelope, LocalOutlierFactor
+ Feature selection using different methods: RFE, SelectFromModel, FeatureImportance
+ Testing of linear models. Baseline.
+ Testing of 5 different advanced models: Random Forest, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM. Bagging and stacking have also been tested.
+ Hyperparameter tuning
