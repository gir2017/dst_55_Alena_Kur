Main goal of the project: EDA, prepare the data for the machine learning

Main tasks:	
	1. Look at the data, filter outliers
	2. Perform correlation analysis in quantitative data
	3. Perform analysis of the nominative variables. 
	4. Select columns for the machine learning step.

- there are about 5% of NaN's in the initial data
- the real outliers were only in fedu, famrel, absences - so the data was clear enough

Steps:
	1. Prepare functions. Look at the data in general.
	2. Select columns to have a deeper look. Filter outliers.
	3. Calculate number of unique values/NaN's
	4. Replace Nan's by mode values.
	5. Perform correlation analysis
	6. Perform analysis of the nominative variables. 
	7. Select columns for the machine learning step. Prepare the final data.

1. This project was for each student personally. We didn't work in teams.
2. I'm satisfied  my histogram preparation functions & working with outliers
3. I'm not satisfied  my analysis of the nominative variables.
4. I've started learning statistics. But it's not enough for me.
 Need more data about analysis of the nominative variables. 
5. The main result is fully prepared project
6. I could make plots.
7. Need more data about analysis of all kind of variables.
 I think that it's not enough of it in the course.
